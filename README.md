# Astrogeist

**Astrogeist** is a desktop application for organizing and analyzing astrophotography data. It’s a practical companion for the astrophotographer who wants to stay close to the raw data, yet bring structure and insight into their workflow.

### 🌌 What Is Astrogeist?

Astrogeist is designed to bridge the gap between observational data and structured insight. Instead of relying on file explorers and notes, Astrogeist parses and organizes imaging session data automatically, giving you an overview of when, what, and how observations were made — directly from log and metadata files.

### 🔭 Core Features (Planned & In Progress)

- **Automatic scanning** of local folders for SharpCap session files and other relevant data.
- **Observation timeline table** showing captured sessions chronologically.
- **Snapshot view**: detailed key-value display of selected observation metadata.
- **File link integration**: easily open files in your system’s file browser or terminal.
- **Configurable metadata mapping**: define which properties matter to *you* in centralized settings.
- **Modular scanner architecture**: designed to support more formats (e.g., FireCapture, FITS headers) as needs grow.
- **Settings dialog** with tabbed config UI and persistent app configuration saved in a simple human-readable file.

### ⚙️ Philosophy

Astrogeist is being built with the following principles in mind:

- 💡 **Clarity over complexity** – Everything should be visible, understandable, and tweakable.
- 🧰 **Simple tech, powerful tools** – No dependencies, no frameworks. Pure Java + Swing.
- 🪞 **Respect the data** – Data is yours. Astrogeist just helps you reflect and organize it.
- 🧪 **Built by use** – Developed alongside real solar imaging work. If it doesn’t help, it doesn’t stay.

### 📁 Project Status

Astrogeist is under active development. A working UI exists with:

- Folder scanning
- Observations timeline view
- Metadata display
- Settings dialog with persistent configuration

More features and polish are on the way, but the app is already usable in basic workflows.
